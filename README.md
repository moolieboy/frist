now what?
  Why can't I talk to the driver next to me?  All four of them at the same time?  He's got a bluetooth, I've got a bluetooth.  Why can't I have a constant party line of voice going with everyone within 100 feet of me?  Is there an app that does that?  Maybe pile on top of that a rating system for shitty/good drivers?
